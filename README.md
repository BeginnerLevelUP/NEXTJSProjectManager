## FootNote
This was my first time using NEXTJS and while I dont feel like I got to utilize the all the amazing features of Next it was a blast using. After using React Vue and Angular I have to say Next is my favorite ( feeliing like the super sayian of React). The fact that you're able to create a fullstack application with only Next is a huge avantage but I could go on forever lol
